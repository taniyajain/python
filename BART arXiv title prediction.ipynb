      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

      "Abstract:   The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning anddeep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in severalways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems,demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energysaving behavior.\n",

      "Abstract:   A Concept Tree is a structure for storing knowledge where the trees arestored in a database called a Concept Base. It sits between the highlydistributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, withthe intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistentsequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a singlecohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation andsemantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network andwould benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. Aconsistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some otherrules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure canthen be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is alsosuggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis forthe context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to definethis. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could beinherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to theuser and even enhance the query with new knowledge. This is supported evenfurther with direct comparisons to a cognitive model, also being developed bythe author.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

      "Abstract:   The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposedmetaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of thestirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate forthe solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. Inthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current bestsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This providessimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, toselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm tobeing trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-sizeadjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the createdcandidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if thealgorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes muchmore difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latteriterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposedto overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVSalgorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points ateach iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of thismodification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improvedand the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABCalgorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.\n",

Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front.

It sits between the highlydistributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, withthe intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistentsequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a singlecohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation andsemantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network andwould benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. Aconsistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some otherrules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure canthen be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is alsosuggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis forthe context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to definethis. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could beinherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to theuser and even enhance the query with new knowledge.

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching.

A backbone to these systems relies often on thesystem's ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in theirhome. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition insmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the numberof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains achallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which arebased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home areoften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of thesituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to inferuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents aprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in theenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, anestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using aConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensornetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a HiddenMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related tothe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested andvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration anddemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n",

This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems,demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energysaving behavior.\n",

Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

      "Abstract:   The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposedmetaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of thestirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate forthe solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. Inthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current bestsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This providessimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, toselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm tobeing trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-sizeadjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the createdcandidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if thealgorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes muchmore difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latteriterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposedto overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVSalgorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points ateach iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of thismodification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improvedand the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABCalgorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.\n",

Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, wesurvey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning.Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunitiesfor future work.\n",

This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed.

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals.

The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources.

      "Abstract:   A Concept Tree is a structure for storing knowledge where the trees arestored in a database called a Concept Base. It sits between the highlydistributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, withthe intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistentsequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a singlecohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation andsemantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network andwould benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. Aconsistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some otherrules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure canthen be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is alsosuggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis forthe context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to definethis. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could beinherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to theuser and even enhance the query with new knowledge. This is supported evenfurther with direct comparisons to a cognitive model, also being developed bythe author.\n",

      "Abstract:   This article deals with Part family formation problem which is believed to bemoderately complicated to be solved in polynomial time in the vicinity of GroupTechnology (GT). In the past literature researchers investigated that the partfamily formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis(PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time.Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to bethe proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts byallotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) designcharacteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturingcharacteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulatedannealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective partfamilies exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal designmethod is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parametersselection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique istherefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. Theexperimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm isextremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and hasoutperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.\n",

To permit reasoning in cyclic theories, we formallydescribe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We identify termequivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and improve the efficiency ofour approach with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the samebottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers.

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previouslyacquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while itlearns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growingself-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similaritythat is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of thevalue functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resultingmap is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previouslyacquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empiricallyvalidate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and alsodemonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobilemicro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of thisapproach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growthmechanism. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements andextensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real world scenariosin the context of continual learning.\n",

      "Abstract:   This article deals with Part family formation problem which is believed to bemoderately complicated to be solved in polynomial time in the vicinity of GroupTechnology (GT). In the past literature researchers investigated that the partfamily formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis(PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time.Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to bethe proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts byallotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) designcharacteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturingcharacteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulatedannealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective partfamilies exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal designmethod is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parametersselection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique istherefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. Theexperimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm isextremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and hasoutperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.\n",

      "Abstract:   Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, teamformation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects orentities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, wesurvey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning.Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunitiesfor future work.\n",

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previouslyacquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while itlearns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growingself-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similaritythat is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of thevalue functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resultingmap is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previouslyacquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empiricallyvalidate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and alsodemonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobilemicro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of thisapproach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growthmechanism. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements andextensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real world scenariosin the context of continual learning.\n",

      "Abstract:   A Concept Tree is a structure for storing knowledge where the trees arestored in a database called a Concept Base. It sits between the highlydistributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, withthe intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistentsequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a singlecohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation andsemantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network andwould benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. Aconsistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some otherrules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure canthen be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is alsosuggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis forthe context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to definethis. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could beinherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to theuser and even enhance the query with new knowledge. This is supported evenfurther with direct comparisons to a cognitive model, also being developed bythe author.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals.

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals. The paper discussesseveral associated issues, with relevant empirical evidence.\n",

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

      "Abstract:   Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, teamformation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects orentities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

So, it isvery important to have a computerized signature verification system. In offlinesignature verification system dynamic features are not available obviously, butone can use a signature as an image and apply image processing techniques tomake an effective offline signature verification system. Author proposes aintelligent network used directional feature and energy density both as inputsto the same network and classifies the signature. Neural network is used as aclassifier for this system. The results are compared with both the very basicenergy density method and a simple directional feature method of offlinesignature verification system and this proposed new network is found veryeffective as compared to the above two methods, specially for less number oftraining samples, which can be implemented practically.\n",

      "Abstract:   The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposedmetaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of thestirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate forthe solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. Inthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current bestsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This providessimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, toselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm tobeing trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-sizeadjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the createdcandidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if thealgorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes muchmore difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latteriterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposedto overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVSalgorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points ateach iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of thismodification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improvedand the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABCalgorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.\n",

In thiswork, we develop an approach for approximate behavior composition withoutdeparting from the classical setting, thus making the problem applicable to amuch wider range of cases. Based on the notion of simulation, we characterizewhat a maximal controller and the \"closest\" implementable target module(optimal approximation) are, and show how these can be computed using ATL modelchecking technology for a special case. We show the uniqueness of optimalapproximations, and prove their soundness and completeness with respect totheir imported controllers.\n",

      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

To permit reasoning in cyclic theories, we formallydescribe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization.

Though there is a growing body of literatureon this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances specialmethods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, wesurvey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning.Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunitiesfor future work.\n",

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previouslyacquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while itlearns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growingself-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similaritythat is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of thevalue functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resultingmap is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previouslyacquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empiricallyvalidate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and alsodemonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobilemicro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of thisapproach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growthmechanism.

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals.

This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems,demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energysaving behavior.\n",

In the past literature researchers investigated that the partfamily formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis(PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time.Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to bethe proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts byallotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) designcharacteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturingcharacteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulatedannealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective partfamilies exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal designmethod is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parametersselection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique istherefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. Theexperimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm isextremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and hasoutperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.\n",

Symmetric variables(states) are collapsed into meta-variables (meta-states) and inferencealgorithms are run over the lifted graphical model instead of the flat one. Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism. We extend previous work on exploitingsymmetries in the MCMC framework to the case of contextual symmetries. Ourexperiments on several domains of interest demonstrate that exploitingcontextual symmetries can result in significant computational gains.\n",

      "Abstract:   The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning anddeep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in severalways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems,demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energysaving behavior.\n",

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

      "Abstract:   Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, teamformation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects orentities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals.

Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism.

      "Abstract:   The idea of reusing or transferring information from previously learned tasks(source tasks) for the learning of new tasks (target tasks) has the potentialto significantly improve the sample efficiency of a reinforcement learningagent. In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previouslyacquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while itlearns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growingself-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similaritythat is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of thevalue functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resultingmap is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previouslyacquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empiricallyvalidate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and alsodemonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobilemicro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of thisapproach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growthmechanism. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements andextensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real world scenariosin the context of continual learning.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

In thiswork, we develop an approach for approximate behavior composition withoutdeparting from the classical setting, thus making the problem applicable to amuch wider range of cases. Based on the notion of simulation, we characterizewhat a maximal controller and the \"closest\" implementable target module(optimal approximation) are, and show how these can be computed using ATL modelchecking technology for a special case. We show the uniqueness of optimalapproximations, and prove their soundness and completeness with respect totheir imported controllers.\n",

Furthermore, we provide a new learning algorithm, SafePolicy-Model Iteration (SPMI), to jointly and adaptively optimize the policyand the environment configuration. After having introduced our approach andderived some theoretical results, we present the experimental evaluation in twoexplicative problems to show the benefits of the environment configurability onthe performance of the learned policy.\n",

In the past literature researchers investigated that the partfamily formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis(PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time.Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to bethe proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts byallotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) designcharacteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturingcharacteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulatedannealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective partfamilies exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal designmethod is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parametersselection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique istherefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique.

      "Abstract:   Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capableof helping people by providing services related to health, emergency detectionor daily routine management. A backbone to these systems relies often on thesystem's ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in theirhome. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition insmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the numberof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains achallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which arebased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home areoften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of thesituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to inferuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents aprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in theenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, anestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using aConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensornetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a HiddenMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related tothe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested andvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration anddemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

      "Abstract:   Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, teamformation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects orentities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

      "Abstract:   Consumer electronic devices such as mobile handsets, goods tagged with RFIDlabels, location and position sensors are continuously generating a vast amountof location enriched data called geospatial data. Conventionally suchgeospatial data is used for military applications. In recent times, many usefulcivilian applications have been designed and deployed around such geospatialdata. For example, a recommendation system to suggest restaurants or places ofattraction to a tourist visiting a particular locality. At the same time, civicbodies are harnessing geospatial data generated through remote sensing devicesto provide better services to citizens such as traffic monitoring, potholeidentification, and weather reporting. Typically such applications areleveraged upon non-hierarchical machine learning techniques such as Naive-BayesClassifiers, Support Vector Machines, and decision trees. Recent advances inthe field of deep-learning showed that Neural Network-based techniquesoutperform conventional techniques and provide effective solutions for manygeospatial data analysis tasks such as object recognition, imageclassification, and scene understanding. The chapter presents a survey on thecurrent state of the applications of deep learning techniques for analyzinggeospatial data.  The chapter is organized as below: (i) A brief overview of deep learningalgorithms.

This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed.

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

In IBE, an agent canautonomously acquire the expressions to explain its own behavior by reusing theinstructions given by a human expert to accelerate the learning of the agent'spolicy. IBE also enables a developmental agent, whose policy may change duringthe cooperation, to explain its own behavior with sufficient time granularity.\n",

      "Abstract:   A Concept Tree is a structure for storing knowledge where the trees arestored in a database called a Concept Base. It sits between the highlydistributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, withthe intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistentsequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a singlecohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation andsemantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network andwould benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. Aconsistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some otherrules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure canthen be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is alsosuggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis forthe context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to definethis. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could beinherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to theuser and even enhance the query with new knowledge. This is supported evenfurther with direct comparisons to a cognitive model, also being developed bythe author.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals.

Symmetric variables(states) are collapsed into meta-variables (meta-states) and inferencealgorithms are run over the lifted graphical model instead of the flat one. Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism. We extend previous work on exploitingsymmetries in the MCMC framework to the case of contextual symmetries.

      "Abstract:   The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposedmetaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of thestirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate forthe solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. Inthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current bestsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This providessimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, toselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm tobeing trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-sizeadjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the createdcandidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if thealgorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes muchmore difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latteriterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposedto overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVSalgorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points ateach iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of thismodification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improvedand the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABCalgorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.\n",

We present then a detailedaccount based on Nayak's suggested algorithmic solution (the best available),which is dominated by computing transitive closure---bounded in time by$O(|\\mathcal V|\\cdot |\\mathcal S|)$, where $\\mathcal S(\\mathcal E, \\mathcal V)$is the input system structure composed of a set $\\mathcal E$ of equations overa set $\\mathcal V$ of variables with number of variable appearances (density)$|\\mathcal S|$.

      "Abstract:   Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capableof helping people by providing services related to health, emergency detectionor daily routine management. A backbone to these systems relies often on thesystem's ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in theirhome. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition insmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the numberof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains achallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which arebased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home areoften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of thesituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to inferuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents aprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in theenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, anestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using aConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensornetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a HiddenMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related tothe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested andvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration anddemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n",

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching. Thus current approach produces better results.\n",

Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism. We extend previous work on exploitingsymmetries in the MCMC framework to the case of contextual symmetries.

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planningproblems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners workingwith these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely usedheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domainencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacityconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge tothese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents thatrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materialsinto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. Theusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer availableto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problemsbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematicalprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planningproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelledin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metricRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybridheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usualrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures thecausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these twocomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explorehow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into theMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem toaugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploitingstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Ourresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problemswhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n",

In the past literature researchers investigated that the partfamily formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis(PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time.Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to bethe proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts byallotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) designcharacteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturingcharacteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulatedannealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective partfamilies exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal designmethod is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parametersselection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique istherefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\\times} 9 to 27 {\\times} 9and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique.

Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front.

      "Abstract:   Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a popular choice for solving sequentialanytime problems. However, it depends on a numeric feedback signal, which canbe difficult to define. Real-time MCTS is a variant which may only rarelyencounter states with an explicit, extrinsic reward. To deal with such cases,the experimenter has to supply an additional numeric feedback signal in theform of a heuristic, which intrinsically guides the agent. Recent work hasshown evidence that in different areas the underlying structure is ordinal andnot numerical. Hence erroneous and biased heuristics are inevitable, especiallyin such domains. In this paper, we propose a MCTS variant which only depends onqualitative feedback, and therefore opens up new applications for MCTS. We alsofind indications that translating absolute into ordinal feedback may bebeneficial. Using a puzzle domain, we show that our preference-based MCTSvariant, wich only receives qualitative feedback, is able to reach aperformance level comparable to a regular MCTS baseline, which obtainsquantitative feedback.\n",

Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front.

      "Abstract:   Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capableof helping people by providing services related to health, emergency detectionor daily routine management. A backbone to these systems relies often on thesystem's ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in theirhome. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition insmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the numberof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains achallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which arebased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home areoften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of thesituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to inferuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents aprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in theenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, anestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using aConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensornetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a HiddenMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related tothe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested andvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration anddemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n",

In thiswork, we develop an approach for approximate behavior composition withoutdeparting from the classical setting, thus making the problem applicable to amuch wider range of cases. Based on the notion of simulation, we characterizewhat a maximal controller and the \"closest\" implementable target module(optimal approximation) are, and show how these can be computed using ATL modelchecking technology for a special case.

      "Abstract:   With the web getting bigger and assimilating knowledge about differentconcepts and domains, it is becoming very difficult for simple database drivenapplications to capture the data for a domain. Thus developers have come outwith ontology based systems which can store large amount of information and canapply reasoning and produce timely information. Thus facilitating effectiveknowledge management. Though this approach has made our lives easier, but atthe same time has given rise to another problem. Two different ontologiesassimilating same knowledge tend to use different terms for the same concepts.This creates confusion among knowledge engineers and workers, as they do notknow which is a better term then the other. Thus we need to merge ontologiesworking on same domain so that the engineers can develop a better applicationover it. This paper shows the development of one such matcher which merges theconcepts available in two ontologies at two levels; 1) at string level and 2)at semantic level; thus producing better merged ontologies. We have used agraph matching technique which works at the core of the system. We have alsoevaluated the system and have tested its performance with its predecessor whichworks only on string matching.

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previouslyacquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while itlearns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growingself-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similaritythat is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of thevalue functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resultingmap is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previouslyacquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empiricallyvalidate our approach in a simulated navigation environment, and alsodemonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobilemicro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of thisapproach, and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growthmechanism. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements andextensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real world scenariosin the context of continual learning.\n",

      "Abstract:   The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposedmetaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of thestirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate forthe solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. Inthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current bestsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This providessimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, toselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm tobeing trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-sizeadjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the createdcandidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if thealgorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes muchmore difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latteriterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposedto overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVSalgorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points ateach iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of thismodification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improvedand the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABCalgorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals. The paper discussesseveral associated issues, with relevant empirical evidence.\n",

Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism. We extend previous work on exploitingsymmetries in the MCMC framework to the case of contextual symmetries.

      "Abstract:   Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, teamformation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects orentities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections thatsatisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one ormore collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a setof attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.  We develop a formalism that lets users express the relative importance amongattributes and qualitative preferences over the valuations of each attribute.We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objectsin terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up thecollection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. Inparticular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order whenthe intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and therelative importance preference relation is an interval order.  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set ofmost preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, thealgorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at leastone (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results ofsimulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by thealgorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore someinteresting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relatethe properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and thealgorithms.\n",

To permit reasoning in cyclic theories, we formallydescribe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We identify termequivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and improve the efficiency ofour approach with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the samebottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers. We evaluate our approach experimentallyon the ACCEL benchmark for plan recognition in Natural Language Understanding.Our encodings are publicly available, modular, and our approach is moreefficient than state-of-the-art solvers on the ACCEL benchmark.\n",

Symmetric variables(states) are collapsed into meta-variables (meta-states) and inferencealgorithms are run over the lifted graphical model instead of the flat one. Ourpaper extends existing definitions of symmetry by introducing the novel notionof contextual symmetry. Two states that are not globally symmetric, can becontextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables,referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previoussymmetry definitions and can rep resent a large class of symmetries notrepresentable earlier. We show how to compute contextual symmetries by reducingit to the problem of graph isomorphism. We extend previous work on exploitingsymmetries in the MCMC framework to the case of contextual symmetries. Ourexperiments on several domains of interest demonstrate that exploitingcontextual symmetries can result in significant computational gains.\n",

Though there is a growing body of literatureon this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances specialmethods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, wesurvey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning.Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunitiesfor future work.\n",

      "Abstract:   The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning anddeep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in severalways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for adeeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The conceptof explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal systemmechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems thatsupport human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable inorder to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. Inthis work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energyefficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasiverecommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. Thepersuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) oron a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason forrecommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using aTelegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data andhuman feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19\\% on therecommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasivefacts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems,demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energysaving behavior.\n",

      "Abstract:   The \"SP theory of intelligence\", with its realisation in the \"SP computermodel\", aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts acrossAI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paperdescribes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realisedin terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signalsbetween neurons. This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentativeand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in thebrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge arerepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols inone or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised asan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing ofinformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as patternrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building ofmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly differentfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns fromsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments inwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-livedneural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via aninter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals. The paper discussesseveral associated issues, with relevant empirical evidence.\n",

To permit reasoning in cyclic theories, we formallydescribe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We identify termequivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and improve the efficiency ofour approach with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the samebottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers.

      "Abstract:   Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capableof helping people by providing services related to health, emergency detectionor daily routine management. A backbone to these systems relies often on thesystem's ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in theirhome. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition insmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the numberof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains achallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which arebased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home areoften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of thesituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to inferuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents aprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in theenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, anestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using aConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensornetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a HiddenMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related tothe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested andvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration anddemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n",

      "Abstract:   Consumer electronic devices such as mobile handsets, goods tagged with RFIDlabels, location and position sensors are continuously generating a vast amountof location enriched data called geospatial data. Conventionally suchgeospatial data is used for military applications. In recent times, many usefulcivilian applications have been designed and deployed around such geospatialdata. For example, a recommendation system to suggest restaurants or places ofattraction to a tourist visiting a particular locality. At the same time, civicbodies are harnessing geospatial data generated through remote sensing devicesto provide better services to citizens such as traffic monitoring, potholeidentification, and weather reporting. Typically such applications areleveraged upon non-hierarchical machine learning techniques such as Naive-BayesClassifiers, Support Vector Machines, and decision trees. Recent advances inthe field of deep-learning showed that Neural Network-based techniquesoutperform conventional techniques and provide effective solutions for manygeospatial data analysis tasks such as object recognition, imageclassification, and scene understanding.

Therefore, we identifythree distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to asingle-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, wepropose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to theapplicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projectsmulti-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. Weshow how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which canbe a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, wesurvey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning.Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunitiesfor future work.\n",
